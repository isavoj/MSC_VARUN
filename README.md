### Literature and Code for Varun's Master Thesis Project

Welcome to the repository for Varun's Master Thesis. This repository contains important literature and code related to Varun's research on solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with a focus on B-splines. The purpose of this work is to compare his findings with the results of Isabella's network.

## Contents

- **Literature**: The `literature` folder contains various resources, papers, and notes that focus on Differential Quadrature and related numerical methods used throughout the project. This collection was essential in developing the code and understanding the methodologies.

- **Code**: The code in this repository is developed based on the literature reviewed. However, these are  just very simple examples i added.
The DQ -code was inspired by the paper [*Solving 2D-Poisson equation using modified cubic B-spline differential quadrature method*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090447917301521). Additionally, I added finite difference methods.
Both these cases solves the potential for an example source term `sin(pi * x) * sin(pi * y)` and compares the numerical solution with the exact solution. The results of these comparisons can be seen in the figures below.


## Background about the method

## Finite difference
1D Boundary Value Problem: Dirichlet Boundary Conditions

Consider solving the 1D Poisson‚Äôs equation with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions:

```math
\begin{aligned}
-u''(x) &= f(x), \quad x \in (0, 1), \\
u(0) &= 0, \quad u(1) = 0.
\end{aligned}
```

After approximating  $`d^2/dx^2`$ by the finite difference operator $`D^2`$, we obtain the finite difference scheme:

```math
-D^2 u_j = \frac{-u_{j-1} + 2u_j - u_{j+1}}{h^2} = f_j,  j = 1, 2, \dots, n.
```
## Finite Element Method (FEM) Description for 1D Boundary Value Problems

Consider solving the 1D Poisson‚Äôs equation with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions:

$- u''(x) = f(x), \quad x \in (0, 1), \quad u(0) = 0, \quad u(1) = 0.$

In the **Finite Element Method (FEM)**, we seek an approximate solution $u_h(x)$ in a finite-dimensional space of piecewise polynomial functions, typically constructed over a partition of the domain $[0, 1]$ into subintervals (elements).

### Discretization of the Domain
The domain $[0, 1]$ is divided into $n$ elements with nodes $x_j = jh$, where $h = \frac{1}{n+1}$. The unknown solution $u_h(x)$ is represented as a linear combination of **basis functions** $\phi_i(x)$, which are typically piecewise linear polynomials in 1D:

$u_h(x) = \sum_{j=1}^{N} u_j \phi_j(x),$

where $u_j$ are the unknowns to be determined, and $\phi_j(x)$ are the basis functions defined locally on each element. The function $f(x)$ is the source term of the Poisson equation, and $u_h$ must satisfy the Dirichlet boundary conditions.

### Weak Formulation

To derive the weak form of the problem, we multiply both sides of the Poisson equation by a **test function** $v_h \in V_h$ and integrate over the domain:

$\int_0^1 - u_h''(x) v_h(x) \, dx = \int_0^1 f(x) v_h(x) \, dx.$

Using integration by parts and the boundary conditions $u(0) = u(1) = 0$, we obtain the **weak form** of the equation:

$\int_0^1 u_h'(x) v_h'(x) \, dx = \int_0^1 f(x) v_h(x) \, dx.$

### Assembling the System of Equations

Once the basis functions $\phi_i(x)$ are chosen, we express both the solution $u_h(x)$ and the test function $v_h(x)$ as linear combinations of these basis functions. This leads to a system of linear equations for the unknowns $u_j$:

$\sum_{j=1}^N u_j \int_0^1 \phi_j'(x) \phi_i'(x) \, dx = \int_0^1 f(x) \phi_i(x) \, dx, \quad i = 1, 2, \dots, N.$

The integrals $\int_0^1 \phi_j'(x) \phi_i'(x) \, dx$ represent the entries of the **stiffness matrix** $S_{ij}$, and the integrals $\int_0^1 f(x) \phi_i(x) \, dx$ represent the components of the **load vector** $f_i$.

### System of Linear Equations

The resulting system of equations is:

$S \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{f},$

where $S$ is the stiffness matrix with entries $S_{ij}$, $\mathbf{u}$ is the vector of unknowns, and $\mathbf{f}$ is the load vector.

### Solving the Linear System

After assembling the stiffness matrix and the load vector, we solve the linear system using standard linear algebra techniques (e.g., LU decomposition or iterative solvers) to obtain the unknowns $u_j$, which approximate the solution $u(x)$ at the mesh nodes.

This approach generalizes to higher-dimensional problems, where the weak form, basis functions, and assembly of the stiffness matrix become more complex but follow the same core principles.

## DQ- method
As shown in above Figure, the DQ approximates the derivative
of a function with respect to `x` at a mesh point $`x_i, y_j`$ (represented by the dark circle) by
all the functional values along the mesh line of $`y = y_j`$  (represented by the white circle),
and the derivative of the function with respect to `y` by all the functional values along the
mesh line of  $`x = x_i`$ (represented by the white square).
That is, by the differential quadrature method, we approximate the spatial derivatives of unknown function at any grid points using weighted sum of all the functional values at certain points in the whole computational domain.

Mathematically, the DQ approximation of the $`n`$-th order derivative with respect to $`x`$, $`u_x^{(n)}`$, and the $`m`$-th order derivative with respect to $`y`$, $`u_y^{(m)}`$, at $`(x_i, y_j)`$ can be written as:

$`u_x^{(n)}(x_i, y_j) = \sum_{k=1}^{N} w_i^{(n)}(x_k, y_j) u(x_k, y_j)`$  
$`u_y^{(m)}(x_i, y_j) = \sum_{k=1}^{M} w_j^{(m)}(x_i, y_k) u(x_i, y_k)`$  

where $`N`$ and $`M`$ are, respectively, the number of mesh points in the $`x`$ and $`y`$ directions, $`w_i^{(n)}`$ and $`w_j^{(m)}`$ are the DQ weighting coefficients in the $`x`$ and $`y`$ directions.
For second derivative n = m = 2 we combine the derivative matrices in both directions using the Kronecker product to form the Laplacian matrix:

```math
\nabla^2 = I_y \otimes u_x^2 + u_y^2 \otimes I_x
 ```
where \(I\) is the identity matrix and $`\otimes`$  denotes the Kronecker product.

### Imposing Boundary Conditions

To enforce Dirichlet boundary conditions (i.e., \(u = 0\) on the boundary), we modify the Laplacian matrix and the source term \(f(x, y)\). Specifically, we set the rows of the Laplacian matrix corresponding to boundary points to enforce the boundary condition:

```math
\nabla^2 [i, :] = 0 \quad \text{for all boundary indices} \, i
 ```
```math
\nabla^2 [i, i] = 1
 ```
```math
f[i] = 0
 ```

This ensures that the solution $`u(x, y)`$ is zero at the boundary points.

### Solving the System of Equations

Once the Laplacian matrix is constructed and the boundary conditions are applied, we solve the system of linear equations:

```math
\nabla^2\cdot U = f
 ```

where $`U`$ is the vector of unknowns (the values of $`u(x, y)`$ at the grid points), and $`f`$  is the source term of the PDE.

The system is solved using standard linear algebra techniques, such as LU decomposition or sparse solvers, since the Laplacian matrix is often sparse.



## DQ-Spline method 

As shown by Shu (2000), $`w_i^{(n)}`$ depends on the approximation of the one-dimensional function $`f(x_j, y)`$ (with $`x`$ as the variable), while $`w_j^{(m)}`$ depends on the approximation of the one-dimensional function $`f(x, y_i)`$ (with $`y`$ as the variable).

When $`f(x_j, y)`$ or $`f(x, y_i)`$ is approximated by a high-order polynomial, Shu and Richards (1992) derived a simple algebraic formulation and a recurrence relationship to compute $`w_i^{(n)}`$ and $`w_j^{(m)}`$. 
When the function is approximated by a Fourier series expansion, Shu and Chew (1997) also derived simple algebraic formulations to compute the weighting coefficients of the first and second-order derivatives.

The basic idea behind the **Differential Quadrature (DQ) method** is that any derivative can be approximated by a **linear weighted sum of functional values** at selected mesh points. When using **B-splines** for DQ, we retain this concept but modify the choice of functional values by leveraging the **local support** property of B-splines. In contrast to the conventional DQ approximation, which involves all mesh points in the domain, the B-spline DQ method only uses **neighboring points** affected by the B-spline basis functions. This ensures a more localized influence on the derivative computation.

This relationship helps in indexing the mesh points more efficiently when constructing the differentiation matrices for B-splines.

### Derivative Approximation with B-Splines:

For B-splines, the approximation of the **m-th order derivative** with respect to `x` and the **n-th order derivative** with respect to `y` at a mesh point `(x_k, y_k)` is computed using the **local support** of the B-splines. Since B-splines influence only a small number of nearby points, the sum in the DQ approximation is restricted to the points within the **local support region**. 
The derivatives will be zero outside the neighboring points. For higher-degree B-splines, more points will be influenced. 
Therefore, depending on the **degree of the spline**, you can control how many points are influenced by the approximation. 
In this project, we use the **modified cubic-B-spline method** along with **Shu's method** for obtaining the weighting coefficients. In particular, we define the B-spline basis functions `œà_k(x_i)` and its derivatives in the following relation:

> ```math
> \psi'_k(x_i) = \sum_{j=1}^{N} W_{i,j}^{(1)} \psi_k(x_j), \quad \text{for } i = 1, 2, \dots, N; \, k = 1, 2, \dots, N
> ```

To get the weighting coefficients, we follow the DQ method for deriving the appropriate sparse matrices for second derivatives, ensuring a computationally efficient implementation.


In the matrix form, the weighting coefficient matrix of the x-derivative can then be determined by:

```math
[U_x][W^n]^T = f
```

where $`[W^n]^T`$ is the transpose of the weighting coefficient matrix $W^n$, and:

With the known matrices $[f]$ and $[U_x]$, the weighting coefficient matrix $[W^n]$ can be obtained by using a direct method like LU decomposition. 
The weighting coefficient matrix of the y-derivative can be obtained in a similar manner. 
Using these weighting coefficients, we can discretize the spatial derivatives and transform the governing equations into a system of algebraic equations, which can be solved by iterative or direct methods.

### Key Differences Between Methods

- **Finite Difference (FD)**: 
  - **Local method**: Approximates derivatives using a small number of neighboring points (2 or 3).
  - **Efficiency**: Simple and efficient for structured grids, but requires finer mesh for accurate solutions, especially for complex geometries.
  - **Accuracy**: Limited by the order of the stencil used (e.g., second-order accurate for a 3-point stencil).
  
- **Finite Element Method (FEM)**: 
  - **Local method**: Solves the problem by breaking the domain into smaller elements and approximating the solution using local polynomial basis functions.
  - **Flexibility**: Can handle complex geometries and boundary conditions easily, but requires integration over each element.
  - **Accuracy**: Achieves higher accuracy by increasing the degree of the polynomial basis functions or refining the mesh.

- **Differential Quadrature (DQ)**: 
  - **Global method**: Approximates derivatives using all points in the domain, leading to very accurate solutions with fewer grid points.
  - **Global Influence**: Each point affects every other point, increasing accuracy but also resulting in denser matrices and higher computational costs for large-scale problems.
  - **Mesh Requirements**: Can achieve high accuracy with fewer mesh points, but computational cost increases due to dense systems.

- **DQ with B-Splines**: 
  - **Hybrid approach**: Combines the global nature of DQ with the **local support** of B-splines, meaning that derivatives are only influenced by neighboring points within the support of the B-spline.
  - **Sparse Matrices**: Unlike standard DQ, B-spline DQ leads to sparse matrices, making it computationally efficient while retaining high accuracy for large problems.
  - **Efficiency**: Balances between accuracy and computational efficiency by leveraging local support, resulting in a less dense system than pure DQ.
