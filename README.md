### Literature and Code for Varun's Master Thesis Project

Welcome to the repository for Varun's Master Thesis. This repository contains valuable literature and code relevant to Varun's work on solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with a focus on Differential Quadrature Methods.

## Contents

- **Literature**: The `literature` folder contains various resources, papers, and notes that focus on Differential Quadrature and related numerical methods used throughout the project. This collection was essential in developing the code and understanding the methodologies.

- **Code**: The code in this repository is developed based on the literature reviewed. It primarily uses Differential Quadrature with B-splines, inspired by the paper [*A Differential Quadrature Based on B-Splines for Solving Partial Differential Equations*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090447917301521). Additionally, it employs finite difference methods to solve the potential for the source term `sin(pi * x) * sin(pi * y)` and compares the numerical solution with the exact solution. The results of these comparisons can be seen in the figures below.

## Recommended Reading about PDEs

For a comprehensive summary of solving PDEs in the electrostatic case, I highly recommend the following resource:

- **[Numerical Integration of Partial Differential Equations: Stationary Problems, Elliptic PDE](https://www.mps.mpg.de/phd/numerical-integration-partial-differential-equations-stationary-problems-elliptic-pde)**  
  This material provides an excellent overview of different methods used to solve PDEs, especially in the context of electrostatics. It covers various numerical techniques and is a great starting point for understanding the theoretical background.
Additionally, this GitHub repository contains course materials for **Fast Methods for Partial Differential and Integral Equations**, which includes a wealth of information valuable to this project. Be sure to explore the "readings" folder for further insights.

- **[MIT 18.336 - Fast Methods for Partial Differential and Integral Equations](https://github.com/mitmath/18336/tree/master)**  
  This resource originally hosted course material that covered fast computational methods for solving PDEs and integral equations, including valuable insights on spectral methods and other efficient techniques.
