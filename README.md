### Literature and Code for Varun's Master Thesis Project

Welcome to the repository for Varun's Master Thesis. This repository contains valuable literature and code relevant to Varun's work on solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with a focus on Differential Quadrature Methods.

## Contents

- **Literature**: The `literature` folder contains various resources, papers, and notes that focus on Differential Quadrature and related numerical methods used throughout the project. This collection was essential in developing the code and understanding the methodologies.

- **Code**: The code provided in this repository is implemented based on the literature studied. It includes implementations of various numerical methods, particularly Differential Quadrature, for solving PDEs in a computationally efficient manner.

## Recommended Reading

For a comprehensive summary of solving PDEs in the electrostatic case, I highly recommend the following resource:

- **[Numerical Integration of Partial Differential Equations: Stationary Problems, Elliptic PDE](https://www.mps.mpg.de/phd/numerical-integration-partial-differential-equations-stationary-problems-elliptic-pde)**  
  This material provides an excellent overview of different methods used to solve PDEs, especially in the context of electrostatics. It covers various numerical techniques and is a great starting point for understanding the theoretical background.

Additionally, this GitHub repository hosts course materials for **Fast Methods for Partial Differential and Integral Equations**, which includes a wealth of information valuable to this project. Be sure to explore the "readings" folder for further insights.

## How to Use
